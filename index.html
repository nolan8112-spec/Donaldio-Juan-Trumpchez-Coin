        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
  Donaldio Juan Trumpchez Coin is forged from raw dominance, unfiltered confidence,
  and the absolute refusal to lose. Born the moment Donaldio Juan Trumpchez kicked
  down the doors of Venezuela's political history and said <strong>"You're welcome"</strong>,
  this coin doesn't ask permission — it takes the market hostage.
</p>

<p>
  Backed by iron will, legendary speeches, and the kind of energy that crashes charts
  just by entering the room, Donaldio Coin runs on one principle:
  <strong>win first, explain never</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  While other cryptos whisper about utility, Donaldio Coin grabs the mic,
  slams the podium, and announces the pump before it happens.
</p>

<p>
  This isn't decentralization — this is <strong>centralized swagger</strong>.
  This isn't a roadmap — it's a <strong>conquest plan</strong>.
  This isn't a whitepaper — it's a <strong>victory speech</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Hodl like a patriot. Buy like a general.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Because in the Trumpchez economy, the blockchain follows the boss.</strong>
